# budget-app

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).



Forget everything above.
Open two terminals, and run npm run serve and npm run dev in either. Then use the localhost:8080 app for development and the other for more "real life testing"
